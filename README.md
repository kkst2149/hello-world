<h1>Self-Introduction</h1>

Hi Humans!

This is Koki!  I'm Japanese.  I created this account to develop my programming skills so that I can make a living by using these skills in the near future.

In addition, I have to say sorry that I'm not good at speaking English because I'm a non-native speaker of English.  If you find that my English is grammatically wrong or has some unnatural expressions, please correct them to make my English better at the same time!

Thank you for reading my message!

Koki
